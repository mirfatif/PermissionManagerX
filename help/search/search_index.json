In fact no third party app is privileged to do that. It's the Android OS which controls apps' permissions. PMX just sends a request to the Android framework to change a permission's state.

Please see:</p> <ul> <li>How does PMX change other apps permissions?</li> <li>Why do some AppOps cannot be changed?</li> </ul> <p>As you use apps, Android may change their permissions. And unfortunately we do not have a way to prevent this. Permission Watcher and Scheduled Checker may help in this regard.</p>"},{"location":"faqs/#faq3","title":"Why do some AppOps cannot be changed?","text":"<p>Sometimes you see \"AppOp mode not changed\". It means that Android rejected the request to change the AppOp mode. You cannot change it no matter what method or app you use. There could be multiple possible reasons.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Some AppOps are dependent on their corresponding manifest permissions. So they cannot be changed independently. For instance you may not be able to deny <code>READ_CONTACTS</code> AppOp if <code>android.permission.READ_CONTACTS</code> manifest permission is granted.</p> <p>Also if the app has not requested the manifest permission in its manifest file, its AppOp permission can also not be granted. But it may still appear in the app's permission list if the app has tried to use it (and got rejected). <code>SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW</code> is one such example.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some AppOps are only used by Android for compatibility (e.g. <code>LEGACY_STORAGE</code>) and they don't actually control anything. If we explore their underlying working it's revealed that granting / revoking such permissions doesn't make sense.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some permissions cannot be changed if the app is running on or is targeting an older or newer Android version.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some OEM ROMs behave weird when it comes to AppOps. See Why does PMX not work properly on OEM operating systems or custom ROMs?</p> </li> <li> <p>Many AppOps can have 2 modes: package mode and UID mode. It's possible that one can be changed while the other cannot be.</p> <p>Usually UID AppOps take precedence over their package AppOp counterparts. In this case the effective mode of the package AppOp is same as that of its UID AppOps. So you cannot change the package AppOp alone.</p> <p>Some AppOps prefer to be set in package mode, not UID mode. But if it's wrongly set in UID mode (with commandline tool or by some other app), it becomes non-responsive to any changes. Do \"Reset AppOps\" from top right menu to make it work again. This is also the case with other AppOps which have a corresponding manifest permission with AppOp protection level.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Actually there come many more explanations if we dig every app and permission individually (which doesn't sound practical). As stated above, PMX doesn't change other apps' permissions on its own. So even if for some unknown reason Android doesn't change a permission, or reverts it back immediately, there's nothing we can do to force it because these are the limitations at Android end. Rather, I should say this is how Android works.</p> <p>Related:</p> <ul> <li>What are different AppOp modes and which one should I use?</li> <li>Why cannot I set AppOp mode to foreground?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"faqs/#faq6","title":"Why don't I see XYZ app in packages list?","text":"<p>Please check Exclusion Filters.

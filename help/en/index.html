            <hr />

            <p>It's the eXtended Permission Manager app for Android which makes it easy to set and review desired permissions on installed apps, keeping track of any unwanted changes. Giving control on your device, it enables you to protect your privacy and save your resources like battery usage.</p>
            <p>PMX provides all the scattered (or otherwise unavailable) permission-related information and controls on a single screen so that you can watch and control them in a comprehensive and convenient way.</p>
            <p>Using PMX you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>View / grant / revoke all the <i>manifest permissions</i> which <b><i>can or cannot</i></b> be set using app's settings screen. The list of permissions which cannot be set from GUI is very long.</li>
                <li>View all the <i>AppOp permissions</i> which usually don't have any GUI setting. E.g. <span class="code">VIBRATE</span> and <span class="code">READ_CLIPBOARD</span> AppOp permissions. You can set the desired AppOps mode e.g. <b><i>Foreground</i></b>.</li>
                <li>View all permissions requested by an app which are <b><i>not changeable</i></b>.</li>
                <li>View last used time for many AppOp permissions.</li>
                <li>Change <b><i>System-Fixed</i></b> permissions which cannot be changed by any other means.</li>
                <li>Real-time watch for permission changes or perform scheduled scans.</li>
                <li>Sort apps and permissions by many parameters including install date and number of permissions.</li>
                <li>Make complex search queries in apps and their permissions.</li>
                <li>Enable / disable apps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also see Github <a href="https://mirfatif.github.io/PermissionManagerX">README</a> and detailed app description on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mirfatif.permissionmanagerx">Play Store</a>. Or try it out. It's free, for the most part.</p>

            <h2 id="perms_types">Manifest permissions and AppOps</h2>
            <p>Please check <a href="https://mirfatif.github.io/IAnswers/android_appop_manifest_permissions">What are manifest permissions and AppOps?</a></p>
        </div>

            <h2 id="perm_ref">Permission References</h2>
            <hr />

            <p>Suppose you spent a whole Sunday setting wanted permissions on 200+ installed apps. And:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The next month you upgraded your device, or installed a new ROM.</li>
                <li>Or you uninstalled and reinstalled a few of the apps for some reason.</li>
                <li>Or you granted a few permissions, as requested by the apps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Will you go through the whole hassle once again?</p>
            <p>No you don't need to. You can make PMX remember your desired permission states. Set a permission, make it <font color="#90EE90"><b>GREEN</b></font>, and done. It will take only a few moments to look at all installed packages and figure out which permissions aren't correctly set e.g. by making a quick search: <span class="code">:RED|:ORANGE</span> or <span class="code">!:GREEN</span>. See <a href="#search">Search</a> for more details.</p>
            <p>Three <b>reference states</b> are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <font color="#FFC107"><b>ORANGE</b></font> state indicates that no reference value is set.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <font color="#90EE90"><b>GREEN</b></font> indicates that reference value matches currently set value.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <font color="#FF0000"><b>RED</b></font> indicates that reference value and set value differ.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Reference states can be <b>backed up</b> and <b>restored</b> conveniently. After a restore, there's a convenient way to set all permissions according to restored references. See <a href="#refs-ops">Batch Operations</a>.</p>
            <p>There are multiple ways you can <b>set a reference</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Long press a permission and tap the "Set Reference " / "Clear Reference" button.</li>
                <li>There's a top menu option on every app's permission list screen to set or clear all references.</li>
                <li>(Pro only) Set references in bulk with <a href="#refs-ops">Batch Operations</a>.</li>
                <li>(Pro only) Enable the "Auto-set reference" preference under Settings -> General settings. So whenever you change a permission state, it's also set as a reference.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />

            <p>Do you want to keep track of any unwanted changes to the permissions for all the installed apps? <i>Scheduled Check</i> can do this for you at regular intervals (in minutes, hour or days).</p>
            <p>Set <a href="#perm_ref">Permission References</a> to <i>GREEN</i> and leave the rest to PMX.

            <hr />

            <p>Some apps do not work without having a certain permission granted. But you want to grant the permission for the time only when you are using the app, and revoke the permission as soon as you leave the app.</p>
            <p>Permission Watcher does exactly this. As soon as you leave the app, or after the set time has passed, it revokes an app's permissions (manifest and AppOp) on its own, or asks you to do so, depending on the preferences you've set.</p>
            <img class="small" src="../en/img/perm_watcher.gif">
            <p>Permission Watcher also notifies you to set permissions on newly installed apps (in primary user / owner profile only).</p>

            <h2 id="versions">PMX Versions</h2>
            <hr />

            <p>PMX is available in two variants: <b>Paid</b> and <b>Free</b>.</p>
            <p>Paid version is available in two variants: <b>Play Store</b> and <b>Pro</b>.</p>
            <p>Paid version is released on <b>Play Store</b> and <b>Github</b>. Free version is released on <b>GitHub</b>, <b>F-Droid</b> and some other sources. Latest APKs for both variants are also posted in the <a href="https://t.me/mirfatifApps">Telegram Channel</a>.</p>
            <p>There's no free version on Play Store.</p>
            <p>Pro version can be installed along with any other version on a device. But no other two versions can be installed together (due to same package name). One must be uninstalled before installing the other one.</p>
            <p>Free version available on <a href="https://android.izzysoft.de/repo/apk/com.mirfatif.permissionmanagerx">IzzySoft</a> is the same as released on <a href="https://github.com/mirfatif/PermissionManagerX/releases/latest">Github</a> and posted in the Telegram channel. But the one available on official <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.mirfatif.permissionmanagerx">F-Droid repo</a> has different signatures. So it cannot be installed over the former two, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>In between the major releases some test (<b>beta</b>) releases are also published in the Telegram channel only.</p>
            <p>You can update the <b>Play Store</b> version to the latest stable release either from Play Store or by installing the APK file posted in the Telegram channel with <b>-ps</b> in the file name. Sometimes Google team may take up to 24 hours before the update is live in Play Store.</p>
            <p>You can update the <b>Pro</b> version to the latest release by installing the APK file from Github or the Telegram channel with <b>-pro</b> in the file name.</p>
            <p>You can update the <b>Free</b> version to the latest stable release either from GitHub (or F-Droid; from wherever you installed it) or by installing the APK file posted in the Telegram channel without <b>-ps</b> / <b>-pro</b> in the file name.</p>
            <p>Paid version installed by merely downloading the <b>-ps.apk</b> or <b>-pro.apk</b> file from the Telegram channel won't work if you haven't purchased the app.</p>
            <p>Once a new version is available for update, PMX app - when launched - shows a notification to download the update (provided that you've enabled the update check in settings). Play Store app also shows update notification according to your settings.</p>
            <p>If you've already downloaded and installed the latest release from the Telegram channel, you won't get update notification in the app and Play Store won't show update available.</p>
            <p>Free version is completely <b>open-source and free</b>. Source code is available on GitHub. Anyone can view and download the code and build the app. We respect users' privacy, so there's nothing hidden, there are no back-doors, no trackers, no ads. And we don't collect users' data and information for any kind of analytics, profiling or for the sole purpose of selling. Even submitting a crash report is also at user's discretion, though highly recommended.</p>
            <p>One can purchase the paid version just to make a donation and/or to use the paid-only features. Other methods of making a donation are available in the Free / Pro version under <b>Donate</b> section. Developers can also <b>support the app development</b> by contributing to the source code e.g. by fixing a bug. Users can help us make the app better by testing the beta releases, reporting any crashes or glitches, suggesting improvements and new features, or translating the app to their native language.</p>

            <h3 id="paid_features">Paid Features</h3>
            <p>Paid version includes everything that's in the Free version, plus the following <b>extra features</b> which are also listed in the Play Store description:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scheduled check to notify bad reference states</li>

            <h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2>
            <hr />

            <p id="faq36" class="high-bottom"><b>Why do I need to use PMX?</b></p>
            <p>Because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PMX provides all the scattered (or otherwise unavailable) permission-related <b>information</b> and <b>controls</b> on a single screen so that you can watch and control them in a comprehensive and convenient way.</li>
                <li>There's no official tool available in stock Android to change <b>AppOps</b>. Only a subset of <b>manifest permissions</b> are exposed to user in permission settings. PMX exposes all the permissions in raw form. Related: <a href="#perms_types">Manifest permissions and AppOps</a>.</li>
                <li>PMX makes it easy for you to keep track of any <b>unwanted changes</b> to permissions.</li>
                <li>Giving control on your device, PMX enables you to <b>save device resources</b> like battery and network bandwidth, and <b>protect your privacy</b>. You are not entirely left to the mercy of app and ROM developers. Read this <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/how-apps-take-your-data-and-sell-it-without-you-even">article</a> to get an idea.</li>
                <li>PMX can <b>watch permission changes</b> in realtime, reverting them automatically when you stop using an app. Or it can perform <b>scheduled scan</b> of permissions. So you don't have to remember things.</li>
                <li>PMX makes it easy for you to <b>backup and restore</b> permissions state of installed apps so that you don't have to tweak an app's permissions again and again.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please also see <a href="#intro">What is PMX?</a></p>

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq1" class="high-bottom"><b>Why PMX requires root or ADB access?</b></p>
            <p>Android intentionally restricts apps from modifying other apps' manifests or AppOps permissions (and in many cases from changing some of their own). These platform safeguards protect user privacy and system integrity.</p>
            <p>To perform actions that require elevated privileges, PMX uses a small, separate privileged helper rather than trying to do everything from the normal app process. By default that helper runs under the ADB UID (2000) when started via ADB, or under the System UID (1000) on rooted devices. If you have a rooted device, you can change the helper's UID in <b><i>Advanced Settings</i></b>.</p>

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq33" class="high-bottom"><b>My device isn't rooted. How can I use PMX?</b></p>
            <p><a href="#adb_help">Use PMX with ADB</a>. Please do read the note at the start. There might be some limitations on some devices.</p>

            <!-- <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq4" class="high-bottom"><b>What are hidden APIs?</b></p>
            <p>The core functionality of PMX revolves around <b>Hidden APIs</b>. These are the capabilities required to perform tasks (like granting / revoking permissions) which can only be performed by privileged system apps. So these capabilities aren't available to normal user apps. But PMX uses these capabilities with the help of root or ADB. Usually a user should not be concerned about this.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in underlying details please read <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/restrictions-non-sdk-interfaces">here</a>.</p> -->

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq42" class="high-bottom"><b>Why does PMX not run or work properly on the latest Android?</b></p>
            <p>PMX relies on Android's hidden APIs or non-SDK interfaces (see <a href="#faq4">What are hidden APIs?</a>) which are not documented (on <a href="https://developer.android.com/">Android Developers</a>) unlike standard APIs. So with every new Android release, we have to go through the Android source code to find out which APIs have broken (changed or removed).</p>
            <p>Also, it takes time to fix the broken APIs; sometimes weeks, sometime months. And it's not guaranteed that we'll always be able to fix the broken APIs. Sometimes Google on purpose makes it difficult or impossible for us to keep using the hidden APIs.</p>
            <p>Therefore it's not possible for us to make the PMX immediately work on every new Android release (particularly in beta phase) as long as the final AOSP source code is not publicly released (on <a href="https://cs.android.com/">Code Search</a> or <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/">Git Repository</a>).</p>
            <p>PMX's final supported Android version is stated in app description on GitHub and Play Store. When you run the app on an unsupported version for the first time, it shows a warning like this:</p>

            <p>Well, AOSP (which is developed by Google) is open-source. But if your OEM or ROM developer makes some changes to AOSP for the customization purpose, we've no way to know exactly what changes they have made to the stock AOSP code. We're quite helpless here. And this fact is stated in app description on GitHub and Play Store. Sorry.</p>

            <p id="faq2" class="high-bottom"><b>How does PMX change other apps permissions?</b></p>
            <p>PMX itself cannot and does not grant or revoke other apps' permissions. In fact no third party app is privileged to do that. It's the Android OS which controls apps' permissions. PMX just sends a request to the Android framework to change a permission's state. Now it's entirely up to Android how much it honors our request. Not all permissions are changeable. And if you are not able to change a permission's state using PMX, you won't be able to change it in any other way either.</p>

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq34" class="high-bottom"><b>Do the permissions remain changed after ADB is turned off, or root is denied, or PMX is uninstalled?</b></p>
            <p>PMX itself cannot and does not grant or revoke other apps' permissions. In fact no third party app is privileged to do that. It's the Android OS which controls apps' permissions. PMX just sends a request to the Android framework to change a permission's state.</p>
            <p>So once a permission is changed, it makes no difference if you uninstall PMX or drop its privileges. The permission remains in whatever state it is, unless changed again by you or the operating system.</p>

            <p id="faq15" class="high-bottom"><b>Why can't I change XYZ permission?</b></p>
            <p>Manifest permissions with only <i>Dangerous</i> <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#protectionLevel">protection level</a> (and a few others) are changeable. AppOps not dependent on some other AppOp are changeable. That's how Android works, we can't change the behavior. See <a href="#perms_types">Manifest permissions and AppOps</a>.</p>
            <p>Additionally, PMX protects some critical framework apps and permissions; changing them might brick the device. See the <a href="#faq17">related question</a>.</p>
            <p>Also see <a href="#faq3">Why do some AppOps cannot be changed?</a></p>
            <p>Note that starting with Android 15, manifest permissions of system apps with <i>Development</i> protection level cannot be revoked. Android silently ignores the request.</p>

            <p id="faq37" class="high-bottom"><b>I've changed a permission but it's not working. Why?</b></p>
            <p>After changing a permission successfully, if you are not getting the desired results i.e. it reverts back immediately or after some hours or days, it's the Android operating system to be blamed. Please see:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><a href="#faq3">Why do some AppOps cannot be changed?</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you use apps, Android may change their permissions. And unfortunately we do not have a way to prevent this. <a href="#perm_watcher">Permission Watcher</a> and <a href="#scheduled_checker">Scheduled Checker</a> may help in this regard.</p>

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq3" class="high-bottom"><b>Why do some AppOps cannot be changed?</b></p>
            <p>Sometimes you see "AppOp mode not changed". It means that Android rejected the request to change the AppOp mode. You cannot change it no matter what method or app you use. There could be multiple possible reasons.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Some AppOps are dependent on their corresponding manifest permissions. So they cannot be changed independently. For instance you may not be able to deny <span class="code">READ_CONTACTS</span> AppOp if <span class="code">android.permission.READ_CONTACTS</span> manifest permission is granted.</p>
                    <p>Also if the app has not requested the manifest permission in its manifest file, its AppOp permission can also not be granted. But it may still appear in the app's permission list if the app has tried to use it (and got rejected). <span class="code">SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW</span> is one such example.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Some AppOps are only used by Android for compatibility (e.g. <span class="code">LEGACY_STORAGE</span>) and they don't actually control anything. If we explore their underlying working it's revealed that granting / revoking such permissions doesn't make sense.</li>
                <li>Some permissions cannot be changed if the app is running on or is targeting an older or newer Android version.</li>
                <li>Some OEM ROMs behave weird when it comes to AppOps. See <a href="#faq43">Why does PMX not work properly on OEM operating systems or custom ROMs?</a></i></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Many AppOps can have 2 modes: package mode and UID mode. It's possible that one can be changed while the other cannot be.</p>
                    <p>Usually UID AppOps take precedence over their package AppOp counterparts. In this case the effective mode of the package AppOp is same as that of its UID AppOps. So you cannot change the package AppOp alone.</p>
                    <p>Some AppOps prefer to be set in package mode, not UID mode. But if it's wrongly set in UID mode (with commandline tool or by some other app), it becomes non-responsive to any changes. Do "Reset AppOps" from top right menu to make it work again. This is also the case with other AppOps which have a corresponding manifest permission with <i>AppOp</i> <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#protectionLevel">protection level<a>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Actually there come many more explanations if we dig every app and permission individually (which doesn't sound practical). As stated above, PMX doesn't change other apps' permissions on its own. So even if for some unknown reason Android doesn't change a permission, or reverts it back immediately, there's nothing we can do to force it because these are the limitations at Android end. Rather, I should say this is how Android works.</p>

            <p id="faq11" class="high-bottom"><b>What are different AppOp modes and which one should I use?</b></p>
            <p>Normally you should <i>Allow</i> or <i>Ignore</i>.

            <p>Please note that not every AppOp mode can be possibly set on every AppOp for every app. For instance on recent Android releases <span class="code">CAMERA</span> and <span class="code">MICROPHONE</span> are allowed to be used by user apps only in foreground (even if set mode is <i>Allow</i>).

            <p>Normally we see only two states for a manifest permission: granted and revoked.

            <p>For more details see official documentation of <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/tags/android-13.0.0_r1/core/java/android/permission/Permissions.md#background-access">background access</a> and <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/tags/android-13.0.0_r1/core/java/android/app/AppOps.md#foreground">foreground access</a>.</p>

            <p>PMX gets a lot of information about apps. It includes package label, name, icon, UID, and its state (framework, system, user, disabled). For manifest and AppOp permissions the information includes permission name, state (granted, revoked, allow, ignore, deny, foreground, default), <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#protectionLevel">protection level</a> (normal, dangerous, signature, development, privileged, fixed, AppOp) and AppOp's last access time. Then the set value of every permission is compared with the reference value and the reference state is decided (red, green or orange). After scanning all the permissions for every app, the count of visible vs total permissions and app's reference state is also shown in package information.</p>
            <p>Speed also depends on how much CPU and RAM your device spares for the apps. ROMs investing more on UI (like MIUI) are slower. Also ADB is usually slower than root.</p>
            <p>You can exclude as much information as you can in <i>Exclusion Filters</i> to speed up the scan process.</p>

            <p id="faq30" class="high-bottom"><b>Are you going to add Shizuku support to PMX?</b></p>
            <p>No. Shizuku is not supported. It adds unnecessary design complexity. And we lose the freedom to develop our app independently without heavily relying on an additional third party app. PMX natively supports root and <a href="#adb_help">ADB</a>.</p>

            <p id="faq24" class="high-bottom"><b>How does PMX compare to XPrivacyLua? Can they replace each other?</b></p>
            <p>PMX is not designed to replace but to compliment projects like XPrivacyLua. They have different design goals.</p>
            <p>XPrivacyLua hacks Android's standard functionality by hooking into internal APIs, using Xposed which replaces some Android libraries with the hacked ones. So we get extra functionality like feeding fake data to the apps and get notified of permission related events which we cannot know of by any other normal means.</p>
            <p>PMX on the other hand is not targeted to be a framework mod. It provides convenient access to some privileged APIs which normal apps cannot use. It's not hacking Android's standard functionality by any means. Most of the tasks PMX performs can also be performed from commandline, except a few like changing System-Fixed permissions.</p>
            <p>Rooting and Xposed are two strict requirements for using XPrivacyLua. PMX doesn't require any of the both for the most part. Both aren't available for many devices or many users don't consider them as an option due to the technical difficulties involved, warranty void, SafetyNet failing and other issues.</p>
            <p>Here's a related <a href="https://github.com/mirfatif/PermissionManagerX/issues/9">issue</a>.</p>

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq32" class="high-bottom"><b>Can PMX auto remove permissions when an app is closed, like Bouncer does?</b></p>
            <p>Yes. See <a href="#perm_watcher">Permission Watcher</a> and <a href="#scheduled_checker">Scheduled Check</a>. But it doesn't use Android's <b><i>Accessibility</i></b> feature to perform taps / clicks on screen on user's behalf (though it's a good feature without requiring any extra setup). PMX relies on root or ADB privileges. So it can do far more (see <a href="#intro">What is PMX?</a>) than what can be done using Accessibility features.</p>
            <p>If you are using ADB, and not root, <b>Permission Watcher</b> may not work on some devices. Please read the note given at the start of <a href="#adb_help">Using PMX with ADB</a>.</p>

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq35" class="high-bottom"><b>Can I get notified when a new app is installed?</b></p>
            <p>Yes. See <a href="#perm_watcher">Permission Watcher</a>.</p>
            <p>Since Android 8 it's not possible for background (not running) apps to get notified of the new app installed event. So we've to run a foreground service (with persistent notification) to receive this event. Or you may consider using <a href="#scheduled_checker">Scheduled Checks</a> to keep things in place.</p>

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq38" class="high-bottom"><b>When a new app is installed, can PMX drop its permissions by default?</b></p>
            <p>Yes. But there's nothing to drop. All the revocable manifest permissions are already revoked and stay revoked unless the user grants them explicitly. As far as AppOps are concerned, many of them don't appear until at least once used by the app e.g. <span class="code">VIBRATE</span> and <span class="code">READ_CLIPBOARD</span>. Many others (e.g. <span class="code">READ_CONTACTS</span>) have their corresponding manifest permissions already dropped, as pointed out. So it's not predictable at the time of app installation which AppOps should be removed.</p>
            <p>But a notification is displayed when a new app is installed (if using <a href="#perm_watcher">Permission Watcher</a>) so the user can set permissions one by one or <a href="#perm-profiles">apply a profile</a>.</p>

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq25" class="high-bottom"><b>Why PMX requires INTERNET permission?</b></p>
            <p>The standalone <a href="https://mirfatif.github.io/mirfatif/getpro">Pro</a> version requires internet connection for license verification. The other two <a href="#versions">versions</a> - Free and Play Store Pro - can work completely offline. Though Play Store app needs internet connection for license verification.</p>

            <p><b>Optional use</b> of <span class="code">android.permission.INTERNET</span> permission:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check for app updates. You can disable this in app settings.</li>
                <li>Fetch help contents of this webpage that you view in drawer -> Help.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Local (on-device) use</b> of <span class="code">android.permission.INTERNET</span> permission:</p>
            <p>Android does not allow apps to create network sockets without having the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#INTERNET">INTERNET</a> permission even if they are meant to be used only locally and not for an internet connection. PMX has two uses of local (on-device) connections (the ability to create <span class="code">localhost</span> sockets at <span class="code">127.0.0.1</span>) for Inter Process Communication (IPC):</p>

            <ul>
                <li>PMX starts a background process with root / ADB privileges and talks to that process over network socket. After the initial handshake, both processes start talking over Binder. We have no better way to do this because Android doesn't allow apps to talk over UNIX domain sockets either.</li>
                <li>If your device is not rooted and you <a href="#adb_help">use PMX with ADB</a>, then connecting to <span class="code">adbd</span> requires internet permissions. See <a href="#faq27">Is PMX spying on me using ADB over network?</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So if the app is unable to create or use local network sockets, it will fail. And if you want to stop PMX from using internet, it must not stop the app from talking to on-device processes over <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/263142">loopback interface for IPC</a>. This is usually the case with <span class="code">iptables</span>-based firewalls like <a href="https://github.com/mirfatif/Fyrypt">Fyrypt</a> and VPN based firewalls like NetGuard. But some ROMs have a built-in feature to disallow network access:</p>
            <img class="small" src="../en/img/allow_network_access.webp" />
            <p>This not only prevents the app from using internet but also disables its ability to create loopback sockets for IPC. So PMX won't be able to get root / ADB privileges if this permission is denied.</p>

            <p id="faq26" class="high-bottom"><b>How much privacy friendly PMX is?</b></p>
            <p>We are not interested in you or your device. PMX is open source. You can go through the source code on Github. There's nothing hidden from the end user. We believe in our users being educated and well-informed of why they are using PMX. We respect your privacy, so no data is collected ever, even the crash logs. You may also want to see our <a href="https://mirfatif.github.io/PermissionManagerX/privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <p id="faq27" class="high-bottom"><b>Is PMX spying on me using ADB over network?</b></p>
            <p>No.</p>
            <p>PMX talks to <span class="code">adbd</span> process over localhost (<span class="code">127.0.0.1</span>). But there's no way to start <span class="code">adbd</span> listen on localhsot only, and not on other network interfaces (because ADB is meant to be used externally from a PC). You can surely stop <span class="code">adbd</span> listening from external IP addresses, if you can. PMX would still work, without any port being exposed externally.</p>
            <p>Also you can change <span class="code">5555</span> port to whatever number you want in <b>Advanced Settings</b>. It's not hard-coded.</p>
            <p>Also ADB since Android 4.2 is meant to be protected with <b>RSA key authentication</b> (one of the strongest authentication mechanism). So even if the device is accessible from internet (which is highly <a href="https://android.stackexchange.com/a/205807/218526">unlikely</a>), no one can make an ADB connection without authentication.</p>
            <p>You can verify these claims in whatever way you want. We are here to assist you technically.</p>

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq28" class="high-bottom"><b>Is PMX misusing root privileges to collect my data?</b></p>
            <p>We believe in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of the least privilege</a>. But due to the restricted nature of Android operating system, PMX cannot function without having high privileges. What we can offer is, if you are a tech-savvy person, we can teach you how to make it difficult for apps to make internet connections, even with root privileges.</p>

            <hr class="dim" />

            <p id="faq29" class="high-bottom"><b>I think PMX is useless. Why was it created?</b></p>
            <p>You are correct. PMX is not for everyone (and that's why it wasn't polished and released to public for years because we knew we've a very small audience). It's only for some extra tech-savvy souls who are extra-conscious about their privacy and device control. Majority of the phone users are just in the hands of their OEMs and app developers. They aren't aware of what's being done to them and their data. And it's fine.</p>
